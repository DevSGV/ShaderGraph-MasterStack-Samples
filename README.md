# Shader Graph Master Stack Demo Project

This project is intended to work with Unity 2020.2. 

Shader Graph introduces a new Master Stack in replace of Master Nodes in th recent release. And this demo project was created using Unityâ€™s Universal Render Pipeline. In the demo project, we have a miniature beach environment featuring two different kinds of water built with  shaders created in Shader Graph: the waterfall over the cliffs, and the ocean connected to the island. You can find the completed sample scene in Asset > Scenes > Master Stack Demo Scene.
